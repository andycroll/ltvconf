        <p>Your business is a slave to the clock. If you don't work for a day, you lose a day's income. Your earnings are linked directly to the hours your team spends working for your clients. You spend almost as much time worrying about schedules as you spend worrying about the quality of your work. The nature of your business sets clear limits on how much value each employee can create. That in turn limits how far you can go to support them.</p>
        <p>Imagine if you could escape the prison of working 9 to 5. Your income could grow while you and your team are on holiday. Your earnings could be linked to the quality of your work rather than the quantity you deliver. You could build a schedule around your team's lives rather than your client's needs. You could be free to genuinely optimise your business for employee happiness.</p>
        <p>There's a growing group of business living that dream. They didn&rsquo;t run away to Silicon Valley or Tech City and raise investment to do it. They're making a difference to customers and they're living more comfortably than ever before. Life Time Value Conference will introduce you to them and help your business follow their path.</p>
