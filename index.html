        <h3>You own or help run a digital product business</h3>
        <p>You’re already making money while you sleep but you know you can do better. You might be selling an ebook to a handful of customers or providing a software as a service to thousands of businesses around the world. Maybe you’re  somewhere between the two, selling an online video course or downloadable software.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with solutions to some of your most pressing challenges. You’ll have new connections into a network of peers who have overcome the same hurdles you have. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to make your business give you even more freedom over the next year.</p>

        <h3>You want to find a way to quit being a slave to the clock</h3>
        <p>You’ve had enough of working to someone else’s schedule. You might be an employee working 9 to 5 or the owner of an agency with dozens of employees billing their time to prestigious brands. Maybe you’re a freelancer or consultant, selling the expertise that’s taken you years to master by the day.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with a better understanding of the counterintuitive differences between product businesses and service businesses. You’ll know what’s possible without risking what you have or raising millions in investment. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to start building your digital product business.</p>

        <h3>You're curious about businesses that don't make the headlines</h3>
        <p>You’ve seen enough press sensationalising startups to last a lifetime. You’re not interested in raw ideas months away from having paying customers, or in billion dollar unicorns with business models that only work at scale.  Maybe there are some profitable digital product businesses hidden from view here in Sussex.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with a stronger sense how you can start creating value that few journalists seem to understand. You’ll meet people who are quietly building businesses to last rather than optimising for short-lived fame and glory. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to support their businesses. Businesses that are making a positive difference to the world one step at a time.</p>

        <p>They&rsquo;ve all created profitable online businesses while living in places they love. None of them had to run away to London or San Francisco to make their dreams come true. They&rsquo;ve each found other places to call home and they hail from three different continents.</p>

        <p>Jon &amp; Andy have spent over ten years working with digital product businesses. Although software engineers by trade, they’ve seen first-hand how technology is far from being the most important thing in digital product businesses.</p>
        <p>They&rsquo;ve felt the soul-crushing results of too many investment-fixated startups. They&rsquo;ve enjoyed the rewards of seeing independent businesses flourish through bootstrapping their own way to success.</p>
