      <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-lg-7">
        <p>You’re already making money while you sleep but you know you can do better. You might be selling an ebook to a handful of customers or providing a software as a service to thousands of businesses around the world. Maybe you’re  somewhere between the two, selling an online video course or downloadable software.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with solutions to some of your most pressing challenges. You’ll have new connections into a network of peers who have overcome the same hurdles you have. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to make your business give you even more freedom over the next year.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-11">

      <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-lg-7">
        <p>You’ve had enough of working to someone else’s schedule. You might be an employee working 9 to 5 or the owner of an agency with dozens of employees billing their time to prestigious brands. Maybe you’re a freelancer or consultant, selling the expertise that’s taken you years to master by the day.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with a better understanding of the counterintuitive differences between product businesses and service businesses. You’ll know what’s possible without risking what you have or raising millions in investment. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to start building your digital product business.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-11">

      <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-lg-7">
        <p>You’ve seen enough press sensationalising startups to last a lifetime. You’re not interested in raw ideas months away from having paying customers, or in billion dollar unicorns with business models that only work at scale.  Maybe there are some profitable digital product businesses hidden from view here in Sussex.</p>
        <p>You’ll go home with a stronger sense how you can start creating value that few journalists seem to understand. You’ll meet people who are quietly building businesses to last rather than optimising for short-lived fame and glory. You’ll leave equipped with specific actions you can take to support their businesses. Businesses that are making a positive difference to the world one step at a time.</p>

        <p>They&rsquo;ve all created profitable online businesses while living in places they love. None of them had to run away to London or San Francisco to make their dreams come true. They&rsquo;ve each found other places to call home and they hail from three different continents.</p>

        <p>Jon &amp; Andy have spent over ten years working with digital product businesses. Although software engineers by trade, they’ve seen first-hand how technology is far from being the most important thing in digital product businesses.</p>
        <p>They&rsquo;ve felt the soul-crushing results of too many investment-fixated startups. They&rsquo;ve enjoyed the rewards of seeing independent businesses flourish through bootstrapping their own way to success.</p>

        <p>This is one day in Brighton that you'll be able to focus on learning how to grow a digital product business. We've handpicked some of the best teachers in the world. You won't just be hearing inspiring stories. You'll get actionable advice that will help your business grow. It doesn't matter if you're already 100% product focused or just starting the journey. You'll be surrounded by like-minded people who want to help you to succeed.</p>
        <p>This will not be eight hours of you being talked at in an auditorium packed to the rafters. We have some great speakers coming and you will learn insightful things from their talks. But we'll be making sure it's much easier than usual for you to meet the speakers and other delegates. You'll get much more from the day when you discuss your specific business and the ideas you are working on.</p>

        <p class="hidden-xs text-right"><strong>Is this just for software businesses and people who usually work on them?</strong></p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>While some of our speakers and many of our attendees will be programmers they won't be talking about deeply technical things. The one thing all our speakers have in common is that they are creative people. They've all made digital things. Some are writers, some are designers, some are videographers. But there are others who wouldn't consider themselves any of those things. The Internet has matured to the point that you don't need to be technical to start a business selling digital products.</p>

        <p class="hidden-xs text-right"><strong>Is this conference all about making money?</strong></p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>We've made some rather bold statements about how you'll benefit from attending Life Time Value Conf. We're confident that you and your business will come away from the day far better off than when you arrived. But you won't be hearing about exploitative get rich quick schemes. This is a conference about creating value for people not extracting it from people.</p>
        <p>To follow in the footsteps of our speakers you need to be primarily motivated by the desire to help people. It takes hard work to build a business that makes money while you sleep. What you'll learn will help you carefully focus on the hard work that will actually make the biggest difference to your customers and in turn your business.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-4">
        <p class="hidden-xs text-right"><strong>OK, but will I learn how to become a billionaire?</strong></p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>The media loves talking about outlier businesses with valuations in the billions. And when they can't find enough of them they sensationalise the stories of people trying to create them. As a result there's no shortage of speakers and conferences talking about how to become the next Zuckerberg.</p>
        <p>We believe the world will be better with 1,000 highly-profitable one million pound businesses. They are the kinds of businesses that are within your reach. Brighton doesn't need billion dollar businesses that put growth before everything else and neither do you.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-4">

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>The speakers we’ve invited are not "household name entrepreneurs". That's intentional. They're all people whose success is relatively easy to replicate. And they're all people whose success you'd like to replicate.</p>
        <p>They didn't get lucky breaks thanks to family friends, top-tier university connections, exclusive startup accelerator introductions or simply being in the right place at the right time. They didn't risk all their savings "betting the farm" on their big ideas. They didn't become notorious for engaging in over the top publicity stunts. They haven't been responsible for huge failures that have cost other people their livelihoods.</p>
        <p>Every speaker we've chosen for you is recognised for their accomplishments by their peers in their respective industries. They've also become well known in the world's growing community of independent digital product businesses. That's because they've chosen to be more open than others about how they've achieved what they have. They're not afraid to share things that traditional businesses would consider top secret. They're all participating in LTV Conf primarily because they want to help you do even better than they have themselves.</p>
        <p>You could say their public speaking skills have helped them to become thought leaders. But they all spend more time practicing what they do than they spend thinking about it and talking about it.</p>

        <p>LTV Conf will be 100% funded by ticket sales. No annoying sponsors competing for your attention. No grant funding requiring us to play politics. No hidden agendas. As someone who's bought a ticket, you are the most important part of this event.</p>

        <p>The structured part of the day will finish before 6pm. As soon as it’s finished you’ll be able to continue the conversations you’ve started over a drink in a (quiet) nearby bar. We recommend you plan to stay in Brighton overnight or leave as late as possible.</p>
