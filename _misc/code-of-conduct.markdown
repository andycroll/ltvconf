---

All attendees, speakers, sponsors & volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect all participants to help create a safe environment for everybody.

_tl;dr: Hold yourself to the highest standards of behaviour. Don't be an idiot._

#### The Quick Version

Life Time Value Conference is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We **do not** tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form, even if you think you're just 'being funny'.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Anyone violating these rules may be expelled from the conference *without a refund* at the discretion of the conference organisers. _Just don't do it._

If you have any questions, email the organisers at [andy@goodscary.com](mailto:andy@goodscary.com) or [jon@inuda.com](jon@inuda.com). Or call +447446858575 (Andy) or +447766021485 (Jon).

#### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
